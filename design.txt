Driver class:
  Board board;
  
  main():
    sets up the board; we've assumed an 800x800 board for now
    current, creates a Scanner that prompts the user for the size() variable.


Board class: extends JPanel, implements MouseListener
  int width, height, size;
  Cell[][] cells;
  int EXTRA_BOARD_SPACE; //this is going to go later, when we have a better framework
  //for handling borders and other
  //objects in our board space
  
  constructor(int width, int height, double size):
    sets JPanel window size based on width and height
    sets instance variables
    creates cells based on size
    sets the cell color to either black or white at random, for now
    
  paintComponent():
    not sure what all this does
  
  mousePressed(event arg0):
    flips the color at the point clicked
    this is tentative and hinges on decisions to be made about what can be done at Level 4
    repaint();


Cell class: extends Rectangle2D.Double
  double size;
  Color c;
  
  constructor(int x, int y, int size, int):
    gives x, y, w, h to constructor
    sets instance variables
    
  draw(Graphics g):
    sets fill color from c and draws a filled rectangle
